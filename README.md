Fun with Passwords! Spin the wheel of the generator!
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Intro:
Howdy! Here you can find a refactor of a password generator that was previously not functioning. Ive have written a solution which allows the password generator to randomly generate using Upper/Lowercase letters, Numbers and Special characters.

USER Story:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password: 

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. 

WHEN prompted for password criteria, 
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password. 

WHEN prompted for the length of the password, 
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. 

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password, 
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 

WHEN I answer each prompt, 
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. 

WHEN all prompts are answered, 
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. 

WHEN the password is generated, 
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

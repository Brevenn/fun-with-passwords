# **Fun with Passwords! Spin the wheel of the generator!**

#
## **Intro:**

- *Howdy! Here you can find a refactor of a password generator that was previously not functioning. Ive have written a solution which allows the password generator to randomly generate using Upper/Lowercase letters, Numbers and Special characters.*

#
### **USER Story:**

**GIVEN I need a new, secure password:**

- **WHEN I click the button to generate a password**
- **THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.**

- **WHEN prompted for password criteria,**
- **THEN I select which criteria to include in the password.**

- **WHEN prompted for the length of the password,**
- **THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.**

- **WHEN asked for character types to include in the password,**
- **THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.**

- **WHEN I answer each prompt,**
- **THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.**

- **WHEN all prompts are answered,**
- **THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.**

- **WHEN the password is generated,**
- **THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.**
